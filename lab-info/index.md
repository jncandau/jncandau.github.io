    <h2>Join Us</h2>
  </div>
  
  <p>We are always looking for motivated students and researchers interested in quantitative forest ecology. If you're passionate about understanding ecological systems through data and models, we'd love to hear from you.</p>
  
  <h3>Current Opportunities</h3>
  
  <p><strong>Graduate Students:</strong> Prospective students should have a strong background in ecology, statistics, or a related quantitative field. Experience with R programming is valuable. Please email the PI with your CV, transcripts, and a brief statement of research interests.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Postdoctoral Researchers:</strong> Postdoc positions are advertised as funding becomes available. We also encourage strong candidates to apply for external fellowships (e.g., NSERC PDF, Banting) with our lab as the host.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Undergraduate Research:</strong> We welcome undergraduate researchers during the academic year and summer. Contact the PI if interested.</p>

  <h3>Lab Computing</h3>
  <p>Lab members have access to high-performance computing resources through the government cluster and Compute Canada. We primarily use R for data analysis and modeling, with version control through Git/GitHub.</p>
  
  <h3>Field Sites</h3>
  <p>Our primary field sites include monitoring plots in the boreal forest of Eastern Canada, as well as collaborative sites across North America through research networks.</p>
  
  <h3>Lab GitHub</h3>
  <p>Find our code, data, and reproducible analyses at <a href="https://github.com/jncandau">github.com/jncandau</a></p>
